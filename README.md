# Microservices Demo Application

This project is a cloud-first microservices demo application designed to showcase the deployment and management of a web-based e-commerce app on Kubernetes. Users can browse items, add them to their cart, and proceed to purchase.

## Architecture Overview

The application consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality within the e-commerce platform. These services communicate primarily via gRPC (according to Google) and are deployed on Kubernetes.

## Microservices

The application comprises the following microservices:

- **Frontend**: Serves the web application to users and handles user interactions.
- **Product Catalog Service**: Manages the product listings available in the store.
- **Cart Service**: Manages the items users add to their shopping carts.
- **Currency Service**: Provides currency conversion rates.
- **Recommendation Service**: Offers product recommendations to users.
- **Shipping Service**: Calculates shipping costs based on user selections.
- **Payment Service**: Processes user payments.
- **Email Service**: Sends order confirmations and other notifications to users.
- **Ad Service**: Provides advertising content for the application.
- **Checkout Service**: Orchestrates the checkout process by interacting with other services.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheSudheer/Online-Bouquet.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Deploy Microservices**:
   Apply the Kubernetes manifests for each microservice:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f adservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f cartservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f checkoutservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f currencyservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f emailservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml
   kubectl apply -f paymentservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f productcatalogservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f recommendationservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f rediscartservice.yaml
   kubectl apply -f shippingservice.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   Ensure all pods are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   The frontend service is exposed via a NodePort. Retrieve the NodePort and access the application through your browser:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service frontend
   ```
   Navigate to `http://<node-ip>:<node-port>` in your web browser.
