## Getting Started

1. **File Naming:**  
   - Ensure your Helmfile configuration is named `helmfile.yaml`.  
   - Do not rename it to something else (e.g., remove the extension) as Helmfile automatically picks up `helmfile.yaml`.

2. **Running Commands:**  
   - To apply your Helmfile configuration, simply run:
     ```bash
     helmfile sync
     ```
   - If using a custom configuration file:
     ```bash
     helmfile -f custom-helmfile.yaml sync
     ```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Incorrect File Execution
- **Mistake:** Running `helmfile.yaml sync`  
- **Fix:** Always run `helmfile sync` (Helmfile automatically reads `helmfile.yaml`).

### 2. Skipping Verification Steps
- **Mistake:** Not running `helmfile lint` or `helmfile template`  
- **Fix:** Always validate your configuration with:
  ```bash
  helmfile lint
  helmfile template
  ```

### 3. Misconfigured Values
- **Mistake:** Using incorrect key names or missing required values.  
- **Fix:** Double-check your values files (e.g., ensure you use `port` not `Port`). Validate the final YAML with:
  ```bash
  helmfile template -f path/to/your/values.yaml
  ```

### 4. Missing Helm Diff Plugin
- **Mistake:** Running `helmfile diff` without the diff plugin installed.  
- **Fix:** Install the plugin:
  ```bash
  helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
  ```

## Verification Commands

- **Lint:**
  ```bash
  helmfile lint
  ```
- **Template (Dry Run):**
  ```bash
  helmfile template
  ```
- **Diff:**
  ```bash
  helmfile diff
  ```
- **Apply:**
  ```bash
  helmfile sync
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Keep your Helmfile configuration and values files well-organized and consistently named.**
- **Always run lint and template commands before applying changes to catch errors early.**
- **Use defaults in your Helm charts and values files to avoid nil pointer errors.**
- **Regularly update your Helm plugins (e.g., helm-diff) to benefit from improvements and bug fixes.**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:
1. **Check the output of `helmfile lint` and `helmfile template`** for syntax issues.
2. **Ensure all required values are present** in your values files.
3. **Verify your environment** (e.g., correct Helm version, proper file naming).
4. **Search for error messages** in the Helmfile documentation or online communities.
